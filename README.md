## Description

The [Validate Customer Addresses Using a Microservice tutorial](http://tiny.cc/s4-ext-microservice) showcases how to consume outbound HTTP services directly from Business Add-ins in ABAP programming language within SAP S/4HANA Cloud. It shows how SAP Data Quality Management microservices can be used to check and correct address data stored in SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Once the address details are available in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Data Quality Management microservice is called, the entered address is validated, and a response to SAP S/4HANA Cloud is provided.
